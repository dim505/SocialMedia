# SocialMedia
This will be a social media web application (React JS, ASP.NET API, SQL)


My application is now live!! (https://socialmediafrontend.azurewebsites.net)

Technical information:  

1) It has a React JS front end, an ASP.Net API for the back-end and it is connected to a SQL database hosted in Azure.
Currently, it features various aspects from the Material UI Framework.




2) It stores the image and videos to Azure Blob storage.




2) Also, it uses Auth0 for authentication as a service. Auth0 helps me handle the complexity of authentication and authorization for my webstore. It helps me determine who is a valid user and who can access
restricted parts of the website.

Non technical information:  

1) You are able to like/edit/add/delete/share posts, edit/add/delete comments, and attach images and videos to the posts. Lastly, you will receive notifications of people following you.


2) Upload your profile and banner photos. Edit account information, and view some quick profile statistics on your account like the number of posts you liked, number of followers, and the number of people you are following.


3) View a list of suggested people to follow, follow people, view followers and following and view other peoples profiles/information.


4) Search post content and other users. This web app is mobile optimized.



5) Speech to text is now supported (only on Google Chrome). When you add a post/comment, you can now talk out your new post/comment.




6) Meessage your followers though the messenger app. You can send messages, add attachments and emojis. If you are following a person and they follow you, you can message them.
	You can all search though the list of coversations you had, and compose new messages.



7) Now I am working on enabling users call each other via the phone and video chat each other.
